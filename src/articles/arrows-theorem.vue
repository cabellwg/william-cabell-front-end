          On the cold, foggy northwestern shore of Lake Superior lies the small
          city of Thunder Bay, Ontario. Not long after the beginning of time for
          planet Earth, magma poured through Mesoproterozoic rifts into the
          Earth's crust and left behind sheets of hard diabase rock, which icy
          Canadian streams eroded over the eons into flat-topped mesas that
          today cast long shadows onto the vast body of water nearby. But just a

        <p class="article__body">
          Port Arthur and Fort William were two nearby towns, both growing fast
          and both about to grow into each other. The local governments decided
          that the two towns needed to merge. The one big question: what to name
          the new town? The answer: ask the residents! The new city at the head
          of the lake would be named by popular vote. Suggestions were taken,
          ballots were made, and a referendum was scheduled. The day came and
          citizens flocked to the polls to choose their favorite of the final
          three options. But when all the votes finally came in, the tally was
          &hellip; interesting:

          Measuring happiness is hard. Philosophers don't even have a consistent
          <em>definition</em> for it. But I think we can all agree that the new
          city would've been happier with either of the last two options than
          the first (and

          mathematicians can do better than that! What are criteria to which
