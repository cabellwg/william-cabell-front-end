          On the cold, foggy northwestern shore of Lake Superior lies the small
          city of Thunder Bay, Ontario. Not long after the fiery birth of planet
          Earth, magma poured through Mesoproterozoic rifts into the
          Earth&rsquo;s crust and left behind sheets of hard diabase rock, which
          icy Canadian streams eroded over the eons into flat-topped mesas that
          today cast long shadows onto the vast body of water nearby. But just a

          on January 1, 1970, at midnight Eastern Standard Time, something a bit
          more puzzling happened in this spot. Two towns merged into one.

        <p class="article__body">
          Port Arthur and Fort William were two nearby towns, both growing fast
          and both about to grow into each other. The local governments decided
          that the two towns needed to merge. They had one question: what to
          name the new town? They also had an answer: ask the residents! The new
          city at the head of the lake would be named by popular vote.
          Suggestions were taken, ballots were drawn up with the leading
          suggestions, and a referendum was scheduled. The day came and citizens
          flocked to the polls to choose their favorite of the final three
          options. But when all the votes finally came in, the tally was
          &hellip; interesting:

          But before we pillory any particular method, let&rsquo;s first prove
          that a fair system exists. We will explore some foundational results
          of social choice theory, a branch of mathematics dedicated to formally
          studying such problems.
        </p>

          20th century, mathematician Kenneth Arrow theorized three<sup

          conditions that any mathematically fair voting system should satisfy.
          Make sure you agree with each one before moving on â€“ they&rsquo;re all
          quite reasonable.

        <h3 class="article__subsubheading">0. Unanimity</h3>

        <p class="article__body">
          A voting system respects unanimity if when every single person votes
          for one candidate, that candidate wins. First-past-the-post systems
          obviously satisfy unanimity. For any ranked voting system, we phrase
          unanimity as follows: if every person ranks candidate
          <eqn eqn="A" /> higher than candidate <eqn eqn="B" />, then the
          outcome will rank candidate <eqn eqn="A" /> higher than candidate
          <eqn eqn="B" />. Note that candidate <eqn eqn="A" /> doesn&rsquo;t
          necessarily win, but only beats candidate <eqn eqn="B" />. For all we
          care, a third, dark horse candidate <eqn eqn="C" /> could beat both
          <eqn eqn="A" /> and <eqn eqn="B" />. And, if one single person ranks
          <eqn eqn="B" /> above <eqn eqn="A" />, we don&rsquo;t have any
          constraints on the outcome anymore. <eqn eqn="A" /> could beat
          <eqn eqn="B" /> or <eqn eqn="B" /> could beat <eqn eqn="A" />. It
          doesn&rsquo;t concern unanimity anymore. Unanimity is sometimes
          referred to as the weak Pareto condition or Pareto efficiency.
        </p>

        <h3 class="article__subsubheading">1. Nondictatorship</h3>

        <p class="article__body">
          A voting system respects nondictatorship if there is no person
          <eqn eqn="P" /> who can always determine the outcome of the election.
          For example, a voting system that discards every ranking except person
          <eqn eqn="P" />&rsquo;s and then uses <eqn eqn="P" />&rsquo;s ballot
          to determine the outcome violates nondictatorship.

          2. Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives
        </h3>

        <p class="article__body">
          A voting system respects independence of irrelevant alternatives if a
          candidate dropping out doesn&rsquo;t affect the results. Let&rsquo;s
          walk through an example before we state it more formally. Suppose
          Senators Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and John C. Calhoun all decide to
          run for the same Senate seat. Clay barely wins, Webster follows in
          second, and Calhoun ends up third. The narrowly decided election falls
          within the margin for a mandatory recount. But before the second
          tally, Senator Webster decides that he would rather allocate his time
          to further developing his

            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webster/Sainte-Lagu%C3%AB_method"

            class="article__body--link"
            >apportionment algorithm</a
          >, and withdraws. Fortunately, everyone specified a second choice, so
          the count can continue without a second whole election. Then the
          second time, Calhoun beats Clay! Apparently, many of Webster&rsquo;s
          voters specified Calhoun as their second choice. This outcome confuses
          the voters â€“ if the people preferred Calhoun to Clay in a direct
          match-up, obviously Clay should never beat Calhoun! A voting system
          satisfying independence of irrelevant alternatives must preserve the
          relative ranking of candidates, regardless of any other
          candidate&rsquo;s addition into or removal from the election.

          Now we will tell the story of an election with a voting system

          But then Karen notices something. She may not have any competition
          after all. The pivotal voter for <eqn eqn="B" /> over
          <eqn eqn="C" /> (the dictator for <eqn eqn="B" /> over
          <eqn eqn="A" />) must appear in line before or at the same place as
          Karen, or else Karen wouldn&rsquo;t be able to truly choose
          <eqn eqn="B" /> over <eqn eqn="C" />. By the same logic, the dictator
          for <eqn eqn="C" /> over <eqn eqn="B" /> must appear after or in the
          same place as the pivotal voter for <eqn eqn="B" /> over
          <eqn eqn="C" />. But nothing about the story we&rsquo;ve told so far
          depends on <eqn eqn="B" /> and <eqn eqn="C" /> specifically. That
          means we could switch <eqn eqn="B" /> and <eqn eqn="C" /> on
          everyone&rsquo;s ballots and everything established so far would
          remain (with <eqn eqn="B" /> and <eqn eqn="C" /> switched). Once
          again, Karen&rsquo;s observation leads to a startling realization.
          Since the dictator for <eqn eqn="C" /> over <eqn eqn="B" /> must
          appear both before or at the same place as Karen and after or at the
          same place as Karen, Karen must be the dictator for
          <eqn eqn="C" /> over <eqn eqn="B" />. Karen, then, chooses which of
          <eqn eqn="B" /> or <eqn eqn="C" /> beats the other in every case.
          Karen is a dictator for <eqn eqn="B" /> and <eqn eqn="C" />. But the
          dictator for <eqn eqn="B" /> over <eqn eqn="A" /> was also sandwiched
          in between Karen and Karen. That means Karen must also be the dictator
          for <eqn eqn="B" /> over <eqn eqn="A" />. Repeating the argument (with
          different letters), only Karen decides which of <eqn eqn="B" /> and
          <eqn eqn="A" /> beats the other. Therefore Karen, from her humble
          beginnings as citizen <eqn eqn="k" />, used deductive reasoning to
          determine that she completely dictates the outcome of the election.

          In practice, voting systems usually break independence of irrelevant
          alternatives. As the city of Thunder Bay learned at its foundation,
          first-past-the-post certainly does. But do not lose all hope â€“ though
          no perfect system exists, some systems break only rarely, and we do

          Like the ancient plateaus overlooking the shores of Thunder Bay, many
          truths transcend human scales. Mathematics provides deep insight into
          the structure of the universe, helping to reveal these majestic laws.
          But Arrow&rsquo;s theorem, while embedded in that beautiful structure,
          really says something that is on a human scale. It&rsquo;s so familiar
          a truth to us that it may even bring us comfort to hear. Arrow&rsquo;s
          theorem tells us we will never make everyone happy. People will always
          disagree, someone will always lose, and someone will always win. Human
          society isn&rsquo;t perfect and can never be. But that&rsquo;s okay:
          in utopia, no one ever invents, no one thinks more than they need to.
          Problems drive innovation, and if we don&rsquo;t have any, the human
          race will stagnate. Stability breeds stability, but who knows what
          wonders chaos may bring.
